## Global Max Pooling

Global Max Pooling downsamples the input by taking the maximum value from the entire feature map for each channel, reducing the spatial dimensions to a single value. This operation captures the most prominent features, making it useful for reducing overfitting and simplifying the model while retaining critical information from the input.
